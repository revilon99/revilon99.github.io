## Use as a YouTube Music Visualizer
Open a YouTube video.  
Refresh the page.  
Copy the youtube.min.js code. (https://github.com/revilon99/revilon99.github.io/blob/master/pong-music/youtube.min.js)
Paste this into the dev console (F-12 or ctrl-shift-i).  
Press Enter.  
Now the visualizer should be added above the video.  
Add balls as wished and watch it sync to whatever video you want to watch.  
For best performance keep the mouse still.

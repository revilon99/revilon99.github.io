<p>
This short introduction should give an insight into why javascript is good.
Even though it will never actually get close to a useful number for PI,
the theory behind the method can be easily executed and visualised, which
is more important than creating the new certain value for PI.

    Imagine the following set up:<br>
    If a circle, with a radius of 1 fit perfectly inside a square,
    then the square would have a length of 2 on both sides.<br>
    From our knowledge of maths, we can say:<br><br>
    The area of the circle = πr^2, hence:<br>
    A_circle = π<br><br>
    The area of the square = w*h, hence:<br>
    A_square = 2*2 = 4<br>
</p>

</div><br><br>

<div class="img">
<img src="img/img-2.png"></img>
<p>
Now imagine if we were to choose a random point in the space, as shown.
<br><br>
Using the equation of the circle, x^2 + y^2 = r^2<br><br>
We know that by checking if x^2 + y^2 < r^2, we can find out whether
or not the point lies inside the circle.<br><br>

From the areas, we know that the probablity of being inside the circle
is the <br> (area of the circle) / (area of the square), or<br>
<eq>P(hit) = π / 4</eq>
</p>
</div><br>

<p>
We can estimate P(hit) by choosing continally calculating 
whether a random point is in the circle or not.<br>

<eq>P(hit) ~= num in circle / total num</eq><br>

By Subbing Eq.1 into Eq.2:<br>

<eq>π / 4 ~= num in circle / total num</eq><br>

Therefore we can say:<br>
<eq> π = 4 * (num in circle / total num) </eq><br>
</p>

<h3>JavaScript Implementation</h3>
This is one of the best demonstrations of the limitations of JavaScript,
however that is not the point of this activity, its more to show the theory behind
how PI is actually calculated in the real world.<br>

The best way to iterate things in JavaScript is by using 
<code class="txt">requestAnimationFrame(func)</code>, since it interferes the least
with the general performance of the page. The difficulty lies in deciding 
how many iterations to do during a tick. The essential rule is that the calculation
time is less than the time till the next tick.<br>
In this case we will just set it to an arbitrary value of 500.<br><br>

<h4>Setting up initial variables</h4>
The canvas is to visually demonstrate how the program works
<code>var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

var hit = 0, total = 0, PI = 0;

const calculationsPerTick = 500;

var running = false;
</code><br>

<h4>Loop</h4>
By using just buttons to control the loop we can define
the following functions:<br>
<code>function startstop(){
    running = !running;
    if(running){
        tick();
        document.getElementById('startstopbutton').innerHTML = "Stop";
    }else document.getElementById('startstopbutton').innerHTML = "Start";
}

function tick(){
    if(running) requestAnimationFrame(tick);
    
    //Calculate a random point calculationsPerTick number of times per frame
    for(var i = 0; i < calculationsPerTick; i++) calculate();

    //From Eq.4
    PI = 4 * (hit / total);

    //Display Results
    document.getElementById('pi').innerHTML = PI;
    document.getElementById('hits').innerHTML = hit;
    document.getElementById('total').innerHTML = total;
}
</code><br>

<h4>calculate()</h4>
Generates a random point, and checks whether or not it lies in the circle
<code>function calculate(){
    total++;
    ctx.fillStyle = "#ff0000"; //Pixel default as red
    //Generate a random point between (-1, -1) to (1, 1)
    var x = 1 - Math.random()*2, y = 1 - Math.random()*2;

    if(x*x + y*y < 1){
        hit++;
        //Change pixel colour to green if in circle
        ctx.fillStyle = '#6be841'; 
    }
    
    //Draw pixel relative to canvas dimensions
    ctx.fillRect((x + 1)*canvas.clientWidth/2, (y + 1)*canvas.clientWidth/2, 1, 1);
}
</code><br>

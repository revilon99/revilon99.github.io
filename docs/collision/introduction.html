<p>
This document will hopefully give a useful introduction to how
collision mechanics work.
</p>

<p>
We will only be covering circles for now because of the
simplicity of the equation.<br>
<eq>(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2</eq><br>
Circles are one of the few shapes where all the required information
for overlap is given in 3 variables, which will make the maths much
easier later on.
</p>
<p>
Have a play around with this demo to see how easy circles really are.
</p>
<ocass id="circle" js="scripts/circle-eq.js" width="500" height="500"></ocass><br>
<p>
With this information we can go on to calculate the types of collisions
this circle might experience.
</p>
<p>
You may be thinking that circles are not very useful and there are so many different
shapes, but because circles only require 1 boolean function, they are extremely
efficient, which when millions of collisions are being calculated per tick is
very important
</p><br>
<h3>Ovals</h3>
<p>
Even though this will not be covered, it is worth noting that the circle equation
(Eq.1), can be easily converted into an equation in an oval equation.
</p>
<eq>(x-a/w)^2 + (y-b/h)^2 = 1</eq>
<p>
Where:<br>
w is the radius in the x-axis<br>
h is the radius in the y-axis
</p>
<p>
Have a play around with the demo to get a feel
</p>
<ocass id="oval" js="scripts/oval-eq.js" width="500" height="500"></ocass><br>
<p>
The properties of an oval can be adjusted so that it can approximate almost any shape.
For collision you can also combine shapes to give a total object. This approximation
is often used in game development since the number of calculations is massively reduced,
and in a high speed game the difference between the detail, on say an arm, is negligable.
</p>

<h3>Circle-Boundary Collision</h3>
<p>
This is extremely easy to do, essentially you just have to calculate whether or not
the distance from the center to a boundary is less than the radius
</p>
i.e.
<code>if(x < radius         ||
   width - x < radius ||
   y < radius         ||
   height - y < radius) return true;
</code>
<p>
We will discuss how to solve collisions later, however often for boundaries its 
easiest to just negate the velocity, in the direction of collision.
</p>
i.e.
<code>if(x < radius || width - x < radius) velX = -velX;</code>

<h3>Circle-Circle Collision</h3>
<p>
Imagine the following:
</p>
<div class="img">
    <img src="img/1.png"></img>
    <p>
    To calculate whether or not there is a collision, the distance between the centers
    of the circles should be calculated.<br>
    <eq>x = a2 - a1</eq><br>
    <eq>y = b2 - b1</eq><br>
    By using Pythagoras' Equation:<br>
    <eq>r^2 = x^2 + y^2</eq><br>
    If this is less than the square distance of the sum of the two radii then a collision 
    has occured
    <p>
</div>
<p><br>
Hence, the logic for Circle-Circle collision is:
<code>if((x2 - x1)*(x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1)*(y2 - y1) < (r1 + r2)*(r1 + r2)) return true;</code>
